<div class="summary">
	<p>I started my career in the IT consulting business as a C# developer, integrating the Sharepoint workforce. The challenge was to develop enterprise web portals, both internal (<i>intranets</i>) and external. Through my experience I've had the unique opportunity to get to know unusual details about the Microsoft Web Platform, as I performed dualy as developer and sysadmin. As a result, I got skilled in farm sizing, setup and deployment, systems administration, load and communications testing, LOBs integration, backend (data storage and business processes) development and UI/UX.</p>

    <p>I left the corporate consulting career to pursue the passion of software development. I then took a role as a C# backend developer and product owner at a product development team (inovation team), working with diverse and transversal technologies. I have with me projects over MongoDB and SQL Server, with async communication through RabbitMQ. I live among Docker containers with .NET Core and .NET Standard. I build coherently with Cake and docker-compose and Jenkins pipelines. I create service stacks with Rancher. I get my code into git. I manage with JIRA. I test it with xUnit, MSTest jMeter and Postman. I deploy it with Visual Studio Team Services. I deliver it to Artifactory. I document it with Confluence and Swagger, and I keep awake with a lot of coffee.</p>

	<p>I have a master’s degree in Software Engineering from the Faculty of Engineering – University of Porto.</p>
