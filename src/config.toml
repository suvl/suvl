There I was involved in developing diverse SharePoint solutions, for intranet and public portals.

That project involved scaling for 12k employees using it for booking vehicles, using team sites, managing schedules and vacation days, receiving company news, whatnot.

There were other projects, of a smaller nature. One project I'd like to highlight was related to the POS systems of all stores of a major telecom provider. The company had bought highly advanced terminals but those were misused just for simple payments. That project integrated their billing and store front systems to take advantage of paperless signatures, integrated payment receipts and advanced reporting features."""
