                        <h3>about</h3>
                        <p>I am an experienced Sharepoint Developer that has focused his career in enterprise web portals, both internal and external. Through my experience I've had the unique opportunity to get to know deep details of the Microsoft Web Platform, from the operating system’s lever towards the frontend. Among others, I'm skilled in farm sizing, setup and deployment, systems administration, load and communications testing, LOBs integration, backend (data storage and business processes) development and UI/UX. Nevertheless and because I believe other technologies and methodologies can bring much to an already established working pattern, I try to learn as much as I can from everywhere. Currently I'm trying to build in Ruby on Rails and next I'm sure I'll mess with Django and I'm very keen to try Xamarin for an app or two.  I have a master’s degree in Software Engineering from the Faculty of Engineering – University of Porto.</p>

My role started to be looking at the old site and the new requirements, then plan and estimate the build. Then I got assigned as the team's leader and we are currently about to go live with the new portal in the forthcoming weeks. The design was outsourced but was integrated onto the portal by our team.

Our task was to create a new, more versatile and easy to maintain surveys portal. This time, the client had an already deployed SharePoint 2010 farm and our application was to be added to that farm. It was entirely custom-built as the SharePoint native surveys features were insufficient for what was intended. It features launching surveys with personalized introductions and instructions, user anonymity as of the survey administrator's standpoint (the link between the user and the data is a MD5 hash, everything is saved with a system account), offline answers (an excel template with the questions of that specific survey and the instructions for filling) and automatic data extraction (joins the various data saving points into a single excel book) for further data mining.</td>

The point was to build the client's intranet portal, a viewpoint for all employees. It was built to support three languages, what spawned three entire interconnected site structures, plus three homepages and a lot of localization and internationalization. It was prepared to be used in Portugal, Brazil, Spain, the UK and the US. There were separate site trees for each of the client's sub-companies, plus big areas for the entire group. So there were resources (like news or images or documents, or even access to certain pages that granted access to other services) that would be presented to the user based on his working company and location. Then it had an enormous social stream. Each worker had a personal site with a personal blog and public and private documents and images. The general user profile page was extended with added components which integrated data from this personal site like showing his blog when another user visits his profile or having a list of links to show on the homepage. The user profile scheme was too extended with a lot of information coming from SAP HR, keeping the portal in sync with the latest changes in the worker's data. Finally it had big collaboration aspects where employees would deploy a massive customised site collection, add some co-workers and use it to share and work together on projects, leisure events or company discussions. During these three years my roles varied. I started as an infrastructure apprentice, helped install the test and production farms. Then since I started in infra, I got to deal with the backend: development environments, deploy procedures, site structure spawns, custom workflows, permission tree maintenance, etc. Later I added to what I did the responsibility of expanding and integrating the user profile service, having it integrated with SAP and managing changes both in Active Directory and SAP (some of which were concurrent). Later I got to load and communication test the application, asserting its capability to withstand at least 500 concurrent users heavily working on it and testing it from Lisbon, Madrid, São Paulo, Palmas and Houston. Finally, after the go live, I integrated the maintenance team, helping correcting bugs and adding new features. Later I was tasked with delivering the project to the project and to another consulting firm, preparing and handling all KT tasks.</td>

                        <h3>hobbies</h3>
                        <p>Got into a regional philharmonic band’s school when I was very young (10yo) learning the clarinet, and never really got out. Went up the ladder from apprentice, going through the years as clarinet introducer, apprentice teacher, soloist and section master. Currently I am the concert’s head, plus I am responsible for marketing and communications.</p>

                        <p>Remarkable moments: organized a tour to Azores single-handed, the band’s restructuration and currently organizing the band’s 150th anniversary celebration.</p>

                        <p>Currently studying at the Lisbon's Metropolitan Conservatoire.</p>
