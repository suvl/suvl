# The great CV

This is my own CV, as a site. I choose it to be a website for the obvious reason that I am a web developer.

This theme is designed by Xiaoying Riley at 3rd Wave Media (http://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/). Visit her website for more themes [http://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/](http://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/)

## Build

`cd` into the `src` folder and run `hugo -b "https://jtsoar.es" --gc --minify` or run it locally with `hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0 --disableFastRender`.
